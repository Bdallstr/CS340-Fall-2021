The Minimalist Planner/Schedule/Calendar is the solution to the problems that comes from... keeping track of things. Obliviously you could just hop on amazon and purchase a planner for $12, use it for a week, and then not touch it for the rest of the year. But what will make this different, is that it provides an exceptionally easy way to re-adjust plans, and practically infinite room for elaboration. A to do list, a planner, a schedule, a calendar.... homework divider, schedule generator, meeting time[er]? Assignments suck, especially if you do it the night before. The best semester I have ever had (where I lost the least amount of hair) was when I used a planner to divide a set of problems over the course of the week. All I had to do was spend a little amount of time a day doing work, and that was it.  Just made sure I completed the checklist for that day. It goes terribly wrong when you miss an assignment, so why not actively divide the problems over your free time as you complete them (or don't complete them). What about school? Tediously finding all the classes you need to take, and which sections intersect, trying to set up your free time (maybe match free time with another person). This would have to be a lot scraper, but would be useful none the less. What of meeting with say your friend john smith? Well just request a meeting, and it will automatically provide times where they two of you are free, and you guys can communicate from there. How do we layout the calendar? A day? A week? a month? A YEAR? All of them could be options? There is so much room for customizability, with a goal of making it all this, and look as unobtrusive as possible.
