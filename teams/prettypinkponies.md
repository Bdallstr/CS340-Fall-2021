Project Proposal: Minimalist Schedule Generator
We want to write a program that allows the user to input events to create a traditional calendar with the added functionality that two calendars can be compared to identify common free time. For example, I could list my classes and a friend could list his classes, we could compare the two schedules and the program could return a list of timeslots where we could meet for dinner, study time, etc. It is essentially just a schedule maker with additional functionality, minimalist just refers to the intended aesthetic.
